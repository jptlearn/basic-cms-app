Basic CMS (Content Management Software) App

This project is fully developed from the backend.
The backend is powered by the Express framework, running within the Node.js runtime environment.

The fundamental parts of backend development are being implemented in this project.
We are using MySQL as the database and Sequelize ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to establish communication
between the server and the database.

Object Relational Mapping allows us to connect to the database in an object-oriented style, making querying very easy.
Instead of writing raw SQL queries, we can use models as objects and utilize their methods to perform queries.

The project will provide a basic registration form. After successful registration, users can add blogs, view blogs, and modify their own blogs.
Additionally, the project will include a logout feature, allowing users to log out from the system.
